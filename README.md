Graduated as an electronic and control engineer from the University of Valladolid, Spain. 
In 2001 he earned a Ph.D. in industrial technologies from the University of Cartagena, 
developing neuro-fuzzy algorithms for monitoring penicillin production. 
From 1998 to 2004 he was an associate professor in electrical engineering at Burgos University. 
In 2000 he received a scholarship from the Japanese Ministry of Education to work in the field of metabolic engineering at 
Kyushu Institute of Technology, Japan.
In 2002 he earned a Ph.D. in information technology and biotechnology from the Kyushu Institute of Technology, Iizuka, Japan. 
From 2004 to 2006 he was a Japan-Society-for-the-Promotion-of-Science (JSPS) postdoctoral research fellow at the 
Kyushu Institute of Technology, where he worked on the synergetic control of genetic networks through transcriptional regulators.
From 2006 to 2014 he led the laboratory of Computational Biology and Bioinformatics at the 
Max Planck Institute for Molecular Biomedicine in Münster, Germany, developing tools for deciphering cellular reprogramming, 
methods to study transcription regulation, and algorithms for high-throughput data analysis. 
Since 2014 he is an Ikerbasque Research Professor, head of the group of Computational Biology and Systems Biomedicine and head of the 
Computational Biomedicine Data Analysis Platform at the Biodonostia Health Research Institute, San Sebastián, Spain.
Since June 2019 Member of the CIBER network of Frailty and Healthy Ageing (CIBERfes) (Instituto de Salud Carlos III), Madrid, Spain. 
Since September 2019 Member of the Thematic Network of Excellence for Transitional Bioinformatics (TransBioNet) RED2018-102404-T,
Barcelona Supercomputing Center (Spain).
Guest Scientist at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Biomedicine in Münster, Germany. 
Coordinator of the European project 4D-HEALING: Data-Driven Drug Discovery for Wound Healing of the ERA-Net
Collaboration on Systems Medicine (ERACoSysMed) JTC-2 (H2020) call 2017.
Is principal investigator of the European project CIRCULAR VISION: 
Circular DNA in diagnosis and disease models of the Future and Emerging Technologies (FET) call.
He develops Big Data approaches for integrating omics, image and clinical history data to study the interaction of
biological networks in terms of their topology, dynamics, and perturbations to interpret complex biological systems associated with neurodegenerative diseases,
cancer, aging, stem cells and regenerative medicine.
His high experience analysing and deriving models from omics data produced more than 140 publications, 
many of them very high impact such as Science (Moore et al., 2015),
Nature, 4 items (Knobloch et al., 2013; Ko et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2008), 
Nature Cell Biology, 3 items (Ohnishi et al., 2014; Esch et al., 2013; Han et al., 2011), 
Cell 3 items (Han et al., 2010; Singhal et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2009), 
Cell Stem Cell 6 items: (Adachi et al., 2018; Song et al., 2016; Rao et al., 2016; Kubaczka et al., 2015; Han et al., 2012; Ko et al., 2009),
Nature Chemical Biology (Kim et al., 2020), Journal American Chemical Society (Araúzo-Bravo et al., 2005)
with more than 10600 citations in Google Scholar, h-index 48, i10-index 111 (June 2021).
